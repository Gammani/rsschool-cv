**About Myself**

I am 35 years old. Graduated from college. Then I went to work in a printing house. After working for 10 years, I decided to change something in my life. 
I have always been attracted to computers, sometimes read and watched various materials and finally decided to get acquainted with frontend development.
I have been studying JS for a year, and I really liked this direction, in the future I want to start studying node js as well, since I see myself as a full-stack developer.

- React (material UI, storybook)
